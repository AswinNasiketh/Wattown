# Wattown
Program for Raspberry Pi on Wattown Energy demonstrator written in Python

The board uses Neopixels, 'Blowlight' light up toy windmills, photovoltaic panels and a water electrolyser. These are used to model a city of the future made up of a hydroelectric dam, windmills, solar panels, a 'fuel cell' and many city buildings.

Please see the wiki for more information about the code.
